InfluxDB V2 (OSS version, not Cloud).

## Features

### Measurement Composition

This component allows composition of
[measurements](#influxdb-data-structure) from any number of sensors
(numeric, text, and binary). Organizing sensors in this way ensures
that all of their values are recorded with the same timestamp, which
enables summarization and comparison in a reliable fashion.

### Batch Timestamps

Multiple `measurements` can be published in a batch, ensuring that
they all have the same timestamp if timestamping is enabled in the
component. This permits summarizaton and comparison across
measurements without having to manipulate the timestamps
(e.g. truncation) in the database query or reporting tool.

### Backlog Queueing

If a time server is available, local timestamping of `measurements` is
permitted, and the component can queue `measurements` if the InfluxDB
server is unreachable or unavailable. Each time the `publish`
operation is invoked, an attempt will be made to connect to the
server, and if it is successful then that `measurement` will be
published along with some (or all) of the queued `measurements`.

### Field Naming and Type Overrides

When sensors are added to a `measurement` as `fields`, the component
will use the sensor's ID as the field name by default; the
configuration can provide an alternative name to be used instead.

Numeric sensors default to `float` format when published, the precision
is based on the `accuracy_decimals` specified on the sensor.

## Comparison to Home Assistant's InfluxDB integration

Home Assistant includes an [InfluxDB
integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/influxdb/)
which can publish state changes (from all Home Assistant entities) and
also import data to make it available for use in automations.

The integration does not have the composition flexibility offered by
this component, and does not offer any form of batching or
timestamping; as a result, controlling the organization of the
published data is difficult, which makes the creation of database
queries and external dashboards more complex.

In addition, dependence on Home Assistant for data recording means
that any time the Home Assistant installation is upgraded or otherwise
unavailable the data publication will be disrupted, and data could be
lost. In applications where the data is being used for long-term
reporting, elimination of the 'middle step' (passing the data through
Home Assistant) reduces the chances of data loss.

## Requirements

* An InfluxDB V2 (OSS, not Cloud) server, with an API token that
  grants (at least) 'write' permission to the buckets where the
  measurements will be written.

* A time server (Home Assistant or SNTP) if the measurements will be
  locally timestamped before publication (also necessary for backlog
  support).

## InfluxDB Data Structure

InfluxDB stores data as `measurements`; they have names, contain
`fields` (named values), and optionally contain `tags` (named
discriminators). `Measurements` also have `timestamps`, which can
either be generated by InfluxDB when the `measurement` is received, or
included in the `measurement` by its sender.

`Measurements` are stored in `buckets`, and `buckets` belong to
`organizations`.

When configuring this component you will need to know the
`organization` and `bucket` names that exist on the server (which will
receive the `measurements`), but you will decide how to name the
`measurements` and `fields`, and which `tags` to include.

## Configuration

The ESPHome 'logger' defaults to `debug` level; while this can be
useful for troubleshooting ESPHome configurations, it can also cause
warnings to be generated which don't correspond to actual problems. If
you have the level set to `debug`, you may see a warning for the
`http_request` component, since it will block ESPHome activities for
some time while it waits for a response from the InfluxDB server. The
warning will indicate that component `http_request` took *too much
time* to do its work.

### Minimal Example

This section is a walkthrough of [minimal.yml](examples/minimal.yml)
from the `examples` directory. It is the most basic configuration
needed to support the reporting device information (uptime and
WiFi RSSI) to InfluxDB.

```yaml
esphome:
  name: influxdb-minimal
  friendly_name: Minimal InfluxDB Example

esp32:
  board: esp32dev
  framework:
    type: esp-idf

wifi:
  networks:
    - ssid: example-network
      password: network-password

api:
```

This section fulfills basic ESPHome requirements: node information,
board selection, and WiFi/API connectivity.

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://kpfleming/esphome-influxdb_v2_oss
```

This configuration requires one external component,
esphome-influxdb_v2_oss.

```yaml
time:
  - platform: homeassistant
    timezone: EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0
```

This section configures time synchronization with a Home Assistant
installation (time sync will be achieved once Home Assistant connects
to the ESPHome API on this device).

```yaml
sensor:
  - id: _uptime
    platform: uptime
    name: ${node_name} Uptime

  - id: _wifi_rssi
    platform: wifi_signal
    name: ${node_name} WiFi Signal
```

This section configures two sensors, device uptime and the WiFi RSSI
(signal strength).

Any time a sensor receives a new value, it is immidiatly queued to be sent to InfluxDB

```yaml
http_request:
  useragent: esphome/influxdb
  timeout: 15s
  watchdog_timeout: 15s
```

This section configures the `http_request` component, which is used by
the InfluxDB component to publish measurements to the server.

```yaml
influxdb_v2_oss:
  url: http://influxdb.example.com:8086
  organization: example
  token: influxdb-token
  backlog_max_depth: 60
  backlog_drain_batch: 10
  bucket: iot_devices
  measurement: info
  tags:
    device: ${node_name}
  #sensors:
  #  _uptime:
  #    name: uptime
  #  _wifi_rssi:
  #    name: rssi
```

This final section configures the InfluxDB component itself.

First, the basic details required to connect to the InfluxDB server:
URL, organization, and token.

The `backlog_max_depth` and `backlog_drain_batch` items control the
maximum number of measurements which can be stored in memory while
waiting for the InfluxDB server to be reachable, and the maximum
number of queued measurements which can be submitted in a single
batch. It is important to keep that number relatively low so that the
ESPHome device won't appear to 'lock up' when draining a large number
of queued measurements when the InfluxDB server becomes reachable
after a period of unreachability.

The 'tags' section configures tags (keys and values) which will be
added to all measurements published by the component. In this case a
tag named `device` will be sent containing the ESPHome `node_name`.

Finally (optionally) any customization for the sensors to be published
can be made. The key under sensors is the ID of the sensor to customize.
Here you can override the name of the sensor, wether to ignore it, the
measurement where the sensor values should be written and any additional
tags the sensor value should have.

By default all sensors defined are pushed to the top-level measurement.
The default name of the sensor is based on the ID (or name) of the
underlaying sensor.
